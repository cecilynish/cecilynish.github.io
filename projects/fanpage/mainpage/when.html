			When I still lived in Providence, I would go to the Nature Lab to relax and draw. If I was ever stressed about school or was just feeling bored, the Nature Lab was a place where I could escape and unwind. Sometimes I’d spend hours there drawing, and sometimes I’d go just to look through their cabinets that were filled with all types of specimens.
